# Sunsetter

Uses [SunsetWx](https://sunsetwx.com/) to get daily sunset quality predictions and sends a text if it's predicted to be above a predefined threshold.

### Making it work

This works best when triggered via a daily cron job after 1pm local time. I recommend hosting with [Zeit](http://zeit.co/) and triggering with [Easy Cron](https://www.easycron.com).
